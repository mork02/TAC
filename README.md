This app shows the user if the streamer is online or offline in a small UI. User can add and remove streamers.
Adding, if user want it, a notification if streamer is online

Why dont i use HTTP? I dont want to ask the server every x seconds for infos, i want to have a stable connection with twitch and if any streamer changes his isLive status, ill get a notification.
thats because i am using EventSub WebSocket from Twitch
